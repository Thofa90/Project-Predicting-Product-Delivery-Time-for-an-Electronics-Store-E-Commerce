# Project: Predicting Product Delivery Time for an Electronics Store E-Commerce
**üìù Project Summary**

This project focuses on predicting on-time vs. delayed deliveries using machine learning techniques in the e-commerce logistics domain. After performing thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training, multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost were evaluated. The models were assessed based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC, with a special emphasis on minimizing false negatives (missed late deliveries), which is critical for business impact.

After hyperparameter tuning, XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model, striking the optimal balance between Precision and Recall, and achieving the highest ROC-AUC score. Feature importance analysis revealed that Discount Offered, Prior Purchases, and Product Weight are the most influential variables affecting delivery delays. These insights can help businesses optimize logistics and improve customer satisfaction by proactively managing high-risk deliveries.

**‚úÖ Conclusion**

**4. Motivation / Problem Statement**

Late deliveries lead to customer dissatisfaction and increased logistics cost. By predicting delays in advance, the company can proactively adjust shipping plans, prioritize resources, and potentially reduce the rate of late deliveries.

**5. Dataset Overview**

- ~11,000 transactions from an e-commerce electronics store
- Columns include:
  - `Warehouse_block`, `Mode_of_Shipment`, `Customer_care_calls`,
  - `Customer_rating`, `Cost_of_the_Product`, `Discount_offered`,
    `Weight_in_gms`, `Prior_purchase`,`product_Importance`,` Gender`,` Reached.on.Time_Y.N(target: 0 = on time, 1 = delayed)`

**6. Exploratory Data Analysis Summary (EDA)**

üìä Basic Information

	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Clean Dataset: No missing or duplicate values.
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Target Imbalance: 60% delayed vs. 40% on-time deliveries.

üî¢ Numerical Insights:

	‚Ä¢	Customer Care Calls: Mostly 3‚Äì4 calls; no outliers or link to delivery time.
	‚Ä¢	Customer Ratings: Evenly distributed from 1 to 5.
	‚Ä¢	Product Cost: Most items range from $150‚Äì$270; peaks around $260.
	‚Ä¢	Prior Purchases: Mostly between 2‚Äì5, showing moderate loyalty.
	‚Ä¢	Discount Offered: Highly skewed; most under 10%, outliers up to 65%.
	‚Ä¢	Weight in Grams: Bimodal; light (1000‚Äì2000g) and heavy (4000‚Äì5000g) products.

üì¶ Boxplot vs Target Variable:

	‚Ä¢	Higher Discounts ‚Üí More Delays
	‚Ä¢	Heavier Products ‚Üí More On-Time Deliveries
	‚Ä¢	Cost, Ratings, and Prior Purchases show little to no impact individually.

üè∑Ô∏è Categorical Feature Insights:

	‚Ä¢	Warehouse Block F had the highest delay count.
	‚Ä¢	Shipping by Ship experienced more delays vs. Flight or Road.
	‚Ä¢	High Importance Products faced fewer delays.
	‚Ä¢	Gender showed no meaningful difference in delay frequency.
	‚Ä¢	High Discounts impacted delivery across all importance and customer types.

üîÅ Correlation Summary:

	‚Ä¢	Strongest Delay Indicators:
	‚Ä¢	+0.40 ‚Üí Higher discounts = more delays
	‚Ä¢	-0.27 ‚Üí Heavier products = fewer delays
	‚Ä¢	Weak Influence: Customer behavior, product importance, and shipment type (individually).

üìå Final Notes:

	‚Ä¢	Multivariate patterns (e.g., light products + ship + high discount) are more predictive than individual features.
	‚Ä¢	EDA suggests that discount strategy and logistics optimization can significantly reduce delays.

**üßπ Data Preprocessing Steps before Modeling**

The following preprocessing steps were applied to prepare the data for machine learning:

	1.	Dropped Unnecessary Columns: Removed columns like ID that don‚Äôt contribute to prediction.
	2.	Outlier Capping: Applied IQR method to cap extreme values in numerical features (e.g., prior purchases, weight, discount).
	3.	Skewness Handling: Applied log transformation to highly skewed columns like Discount_offered and Prior_purchases.
	4.	Categorical Encoding: Used Label Encoding to convert categorical variables (Warehouse_block, Mode_of_Shipment, Product_importance, Gender) into numeric form.
	5.	Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using a standard 80-20 ratio for model evaluation.
	6.	Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to normalize all numeric features and bring them to the same scale for consistent model performance.
